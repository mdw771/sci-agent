# Sci-agent

Sci-agent is a lightweight, simple, easy-to-use yet powerful agentic AI framework for building AI agents that can be easily connected with experiment control systems and scientific computing tools.

## Why sci-agent?

- *No multithreading complications*. Experiment control libraries are not always thread-safe. Agentic AI frameworks that execute tools in spawned threads can crash and result in painful debugging and redesigns. Parallel execution of instrument-control tools are either not possible or likely to cause a real-world disaster. So we take this variable out of the equation.
- *Transparency*. When building an experiment automation agent, every tool call matters. A bad tool call can crash a lab instrument. We believe every tool call should be visible to the user, and we don't attempt to hide away multi-step, tool-call-involving LLM responses from the user with a black-box `invoke` API. You control every step of the process and can intervene at any point.
- *Build any type of workflow with it*. No graph, no nodes, no edges. Define your workflow in native Python. Want to let an LLM drive the whole process? Or rather use an logic-based workflow with LLM queries embedded inside? Your choice.
- *Versatile GUI adapter*. If your automation workflow involves system messages auto-generated by system logic, existing GUI frameworks may not directly support it. Sci-agent can write all messages to a SQL database so that you can poll it with any GUI framework, including your homemade ones.
- *Stateful and adaptable tools*. Tools are classes. Each class is a "tool box" that can have multiple methods callable by the LLM. Tool classes are stateful so that you can keep a persistent connection or run engine object used by your instrument control system. The built-in wrapper can serve sci-agent tools as MCP servers, allowing them to be used by other clients. The other way around is also possible: you can use any MCP server with sci-agent.

## Installation

We recommend using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) to install sci-agent. Clone this repository, enter the directory, and run:
```bash
uv venv
uv sync
```

## Agent Skills

Sci-agent can load Agent Skills folders and expose them as tools. Each skill is a
folder containing a `SKILL.md` file with required YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
name: <short-identifier>
description: <when to use this skill>
---
```

The Markdown body can include any workflow instructions, examples, or templates.
Configure `skill_dirs` on `BaseTaskManager` to point at skill directories (see
`skills/scan-lab-motor/SKILL.md` for an example).

One important usage of skills is to inform the agent in `BaseTaskManager` of how it
can launch a sub-task manager that performs a particular task by writing codes. If
you create subclasses of `BaseTaskManager` with your own workflow, you are always
encouraged to create a skill for it so that you can let your `BaseTaskManager` agent
launch that task manager through chat instead of scripting it manually.
